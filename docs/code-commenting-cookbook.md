# Code commenting cookbook

Let's cook some comments in code! This cookbook will you guide how.

## Simple local comments

Simple local comments are for commenting relatively to one style block.
Make a new line and underneath start two line CSS comment.
Your thoughts goes into the first comment line.

```css
/* This is super duper
 */
.class.class:hover {
    ...
}

/* Also this is interesting
 */
.class > h1 {
    ...
}
```

## Heading section comments

To keep code clean and cozy sectioning whole code is necessary.
So that's what the _Heading section comments_ are made for.

Simply ident new section with two blank lines and start three line CSS comment underneath.
Then do a heading line. The heading line must be always made of asterisks and have width to 64th column.
Text underneath is uppercase, one space away of an asterisk.

```css
    ...
}


/**************************************************************
 * MY AWESOME NEW SECTION!
**/
#stuff {
    ...
```
